<h1>Welcome to 5-Data-Preparation repository!</h1>


Data preparation is a crucial step in the data science workflow involving cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data for analysis and modeling. 
Key steps include handling missing values, addressing outliers, exploring data through visualization, engineering features, integrating diverse datasets, 
and ensuring proper data splitting. Effective data preparation enhances model performance, reduces bias and noise, supports exploratory analysis, ensures reproducibility, 
and optimizes resource utilization. It lays the foundation for deriving reliable insights and building accurate machine learning models.
